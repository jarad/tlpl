\title{Performs tau-leaped simulations}
\usage{
tau_leap(sys, n = 1, tau = 1, while.max = 1000, engine = "C")
}
\arguments{
\item{sys}{a list defining a stochastic chemical kinetic system}

\item{n}{an integer defining the number of time-points to simulate}

\item{tau}{a positive vector defining the times between observations}

\item{while.max}{at each time point the maximum number of simulations to try to ensure non-negativity of all species}

\item{engine}{use 'R' or 'C'}
}
\value{
a list containing the species counts at each time point ('X') which is an (n+1) x s matrix and the number of transitions between each time point ('nr') which is an n x r matrix
